* GREEDY_GRAPH_COLORING (GGC)
GGC is a program that takes a graph $G = (V, E)$ that is $k$-colorable and a proper $k$-coloring $c$ of $G$, and determines if coloring $c$ is a greedy coloring. This program is the result of a practical activity in the Data Structures course of the [[https://dcc.ufmg.br/][Department of Computer Science at UFMG]].
